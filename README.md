## Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe or Noughts & Crosses or Xs and Os is a paper & pencil game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a Horizontal, Vertical or Diagonal row is the winner.


## About
This is a Tic Tac Toe game build with JavaScript & popular library ReactJS. I build this game using just the core features of ReactJS. Like, 
- Components
- Props
- State
Although it's a simple game, but by build it I have learned more new core things of ReactJS.
